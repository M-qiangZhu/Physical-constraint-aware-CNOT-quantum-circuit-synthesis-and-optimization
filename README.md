# Physical constraint-aware CNOT quantum circuit synthesis and optimization

This project uses the weighted Steiner tree and matrix transformation method to optimize the synthesis of the CNOT circuit, thereby improving the fidelity of the circuit.
We conduct experiments on the simulator provided by IBMQ to ensure the authenticity of the experimental data.
 
 ## My work

- The main function in /pyzx/scripts/my_experiment.py
- Some functions and classes have been added and modified in /pyzx/routing/cnot-mapper.py
- The experiment result in /pyzx/scripts/resultdata/
